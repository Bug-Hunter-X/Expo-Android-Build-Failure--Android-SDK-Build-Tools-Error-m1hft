To resolve this issue, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify Android SDK Installation:** Ensure that the Android SDK is correctly installed and configured. Check the environment variables (`ANDROID_HOME`, `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) and ensure they point to the correct SDK location.
2. **Update Build Tools:** The Android SDK build tools might be outdated. Use the Android SDK Manager to update the build tools to the latest stable version.
3. **Check for Dependencies:** Review your project's dependencies in `package.json` and ensure they're compatible with the Android SDK version and build tools you're using.  Look for any conflicting versions.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Before attempting a build, use the Expo CLI to clean your project: `expo prebuild --clean`. Then, try building again.
5. **Check for Gradle Errors:** If you see Gradle-related errors, ensure Gradle is correctly installed and configured. Consider updating Gradle and Gradle Wrapper.
6. **Invalidate Caches:** Invalidate caches and restart your IDE (Android Studio) to refresh the project environment.
7. **Examine Log Files:** Look for detailed error messages in the Expo CLI output or the Android build logs for further clues.

Example code snippet to showcase updating the build tools (requires modifying `android/gradle.properties`):

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33 // Update this to the latest stable version
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21 // Adjust as needed
        targetSdkVersion 33 // Update this to the latest stable version
    }
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```
