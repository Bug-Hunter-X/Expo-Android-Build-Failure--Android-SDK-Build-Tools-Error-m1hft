# Expo Android Build Failure: Android SDK Build Tools Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android apps using Expo CLI. The error relates to issues with the Android SDK build tools, often presenting as vague error messages during the build process.  This can stem from several causes, including incorrect SDK configurations, missing dependencies, or conflicts between different versions of Android components.

The `buildError.js` file simulates the problematic build process, while `buildSolution.js` offers a potential solution and troubleshooting steps.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions (if any) in `buildError.js` to replicate the build environment.
3. Attempt to build the Android application using the commands outlined in `buildError.js` (e.g., `expo prebuild` or `expo build:android`).
4. Observe the error messages produced during the build process.

## Solution

Refer to `buildSolution.js` for potential fixes, including verifying SDK installations, updating build tools, and checking for dependency conflicts.
